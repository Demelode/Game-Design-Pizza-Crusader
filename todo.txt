there needs to be a clear sign that you’ve added devilries to that zone, while still in that zone


the map needs to update with new zone changes during the post state

there’s a button issue that’s been plaguing me, sometimes the buttons use one style, somethimes another
also there’s some text size issues in the summaries

so there needs to be some text somewhere saying what state the game is in


text sizing is off on some button labels and such

better looking summary pages

and zone page

like stylistically

hmm, maybe faking matchmaking

or at least make the menu look more robust

fix bot so he isnt a cheating pos

bot names:

ZingBot
MarshaBot
ChenBot
ArisaBot
